# Comparing Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/autompg-dataset

Conclusions:

* For Ordinary Linear Regression, Mean Squared Error = 9.153, Coefficient of model year = 2.88
* For Ridge Regression, Mean Squared Error = 8.728, Coefficient of model year = 3.11
* For Lasso Regression, Mean Squared Error = 9.173, Coefficient of model year = 2.54
* Lasso Regression produces the highest value of MSE and has reduced the coefficient of model year when compared to Ordinary Linear Regression and Rigde Regression.
* Ridge Regression produces the maximum value of coefficient of model year.
